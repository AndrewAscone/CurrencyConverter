The purpose of this project is to practice developing a small web-based application that will reach out to an external API, allowing the application to calculate converting an amount of money from one currency to another.

This application is being developed using Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I will be using the API from exchangeratesapi.io to fetch live conversion rates for the calculations.
